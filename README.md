Let's do a quick FAQ
### 1. What is Bongo Cat?
It's a meme of a cat drawing (originally) playing a bongo.
This is it, but with a KEYBOARD! And... It parses MIDI files.
### 2. How can I use this?
Well, you have two options:
- (easy) Open [this website](https://rafael.wtf/MidiCat/) in your browser
- (not that easy) Just clone this repository and open index.html with your favourite browser!
