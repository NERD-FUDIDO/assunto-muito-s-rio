# MidiCat
Bongo cat but it's a midi parser written in javascript and html
 Let's do a quick FAQ
 ### 1. What the fuck is Bongo Cat?
The "Bongo Cat" is a meme of a drawing of a cat playing a bongo (obviously)
 ### 2. Where can I get the link?
We still don't have a website in the cloud, and development is far away from a stable point to host it somewhere (But I'll upload it to github pages sometime soon)
 # If you want to try it out...
Just clone the repo and open index.html with your favourite browser!
