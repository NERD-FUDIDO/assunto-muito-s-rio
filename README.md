# MidiCat
Bongo cat but it's a midi parser writtenaa in javascript and html

Let's do a quick FAQ
### 1. What is Bongo Cat?
It's a meme of a cat drawing (originally) playing a bongo.
This is it, but with a KEYBOARD! And... It parses MIDI files.
### 2. Where can I get the link?
We still don't have a website in the cloud, and development is far away from a stable point to host it somewhere (But I'll upload it to github pages sometime soon)
# If you want to try it out...
Just clone the repo and open index.html with your favourite browser!
